This repository demonstrates a common Python error: RecursionError due to exceeding the maximum recursion depth.  The `bug.py` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.py` file provides a corrected version that handles the base case properly, preventing infinite recursion. The error occurs because the function attempts to recursively call itself indefinitely when a negative value is given as input, thereby exceeding Python's default recursion depth limit. The solution modifies the function to handle this case by adding an explicit check that returns 1 when x is negative.
